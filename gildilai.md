<li>The letter <code>'</code> is not part of any word, but rather it is used to make clear where a word boundary is, if desired or needs to be marked.</li>
<li>One can use î /ɯ/ /ə/ (generally unwritten) anywhere they like to make it easier to pronounce. Adding it to a word does not change its identity.
<ul>
<li><em>janîs</em> = <em>jans</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A adjacent sequence of 3 vowels <em><strong>in a single word</strong></em> is not allowed. There can still be a vowel sequence of 3 across word boundaries.</li>
<li>The pronunciation of a vowel sequence is a matter of preference. <em><strong>ui</strong></em> can be either /uj/, /wi/, /u.i/ or even /uɁi/ if you want.</li>
<li>The letter <em><strong>i</strong></em> has an acceptable variant, <em><strong>ı</strong></em>.</li>
<li>The letter <em><strong>h</strong></em> is not included whenever consonants are mentioned. It does not have as much liberty as other consonants in where it can be, it mostly acts as an in-between letter in vowel sequences, or as a helper to other consonants.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also these letters that <em><strong>never</strong></em> appear on any normal word, and not part of the language per se, but can be used in, e.g. names of people.</p>

</table><p>This list of “foreign” letters also include nasalised versions of the base vowels, which can either be written with a tilde (<em>ãẽĩõũ</em>) or an ogonek (<em>ąęįǫų</em>) based on preference.</p>
<h1 id="morphology">Morphology</h1>
<p>Just like other cool hip loglangs, this one also has a <em>Self-Segregating Morphology</em>!!<br>
You can absolutely write Glinsert using spaces, and this is often preferred. But you don’t <em>have</em> to write the spaces! The way that Glinsert’s words are shaped means that spaces are completely needless. And unlike Lojban, the existence of a space never implies a word boundary, so you can use spaces howeveran d whe rev ery ouwan t.</p>
<ul>
<li>I believe that the concept of spaces is very unreliable, because all sorts of issues like spacing issues (especially on handwriting) and kerning mistakes makes it hard to discern where a space is supposed to be.</li>
</ul>
<p>To mark an explicit word boundary, use the apostrophe. This is mostly used when a word ending with a vowel before a single-vowel particle could be confused for a single word. For example,  <code>ki'a</code> vs. <code>kia</code>. The former has to be spelt with an apostrophe even when having a space there by the way.</p>
<p>There are 4 types of words:</p>
<ul>
<li>roots: Content words. All of them are verbs.</li>
<li>particles: Grammatical helpers, and catch-all junk that don’t fit the roots category, like numbers and math and letters and stuff.</li>
<li>imports: Proper names. Very different than other words. Generally resistant to any phonotactic rules at all, due to how diverse proper names can be across the world.</li>
<li>miscs: Most useless features of the language tucked away in another category. Formally, a <em>misc</em> looks like a particle attached to a root, but the “root” here isn’t semantically a verb. Instead, it carries encoded information like species id or geolocation code. The accompanying particle marks the word as a <em>misc</em>. Since these words are composed of multiple words as far as morphology is concerned, they are excluded from discussions of morphology.</li>
</ul>
<p>And there are these categories of sounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Vowels (<strong>V</strong>): a singular vowel.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>a, e, i, o, u</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vowel sequence (<strong>Ꝟ</strong>): either a singular vowel, a sequence of two vowels, or vowels seperated by <em><strong>h</strong></em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>examples: <em>e, ai, io, aha, iho, u, uihi, iahiu, y, ehaiha, ihihi, yhy, ie</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consonants (<strong>C</strong>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Initials (<strong>S</strong>):
<ul>
<li><em>p, t, k, b, d, g, j, v</em></li>
<li><em>pl, pr, ts, tr, tc, kl, kr, bl, br, dr, gl, gr, jl, vl, vr</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rest (<strong>R</strong>): they can roam around the root except at the start.
<ul>
<li><em>f, s, l, c, n, m, r, z</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiple consonants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Medial clusters (<strong>Ɱ</strong>): any combination of two Rests except for 2 identical letters.</li>
<li>Finals (<strong>Ƒ</strong>):
<ul>
<li><em>lf, ls, ns, ms, rs, lm, lz, nz, mz, rz</em></li>
<li><em>hk, ht</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Aspirated medials (<strong>Ṁ</strong>)
<ul>
<li><em>hv, hs, hl, hn, hm, hr, hz</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Same con<br>
No non-import word can start with <em>ty</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are how the words are formed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Particle: <strong>S?Ꝟ</strong>
<ul>
<li>a vowel or a vowel sequence, with or without an initial before
<ul>
<li><em>ke, ia, py, clai, y, o, u, va.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Root:
<ul>
<li>Plain: <strong>S(Ꝟ(R|Ɱ))*Ꝟ(Ƒ|R)</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>tes, bar, kuir, tcehar, jans, palrans, fars, taht, pluhk, tohaht</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Aspirated middle: <strong>S(Ꝟ(R|Ɱ))*ꝞṀ((Ꝟ(Ƒ|R))|V)</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>tahlil, pahlu, pehsi, glahsamz</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Import: starts with the sequence <em><strong>ty</strong></em> to make it clear it’s an import. never stops until there is an apostrophe at the end.
<ul>
<li>Phonetically, it can’t end with a cluster, it can only end with vowels, or the consonants <em>n, m, r, v, l, p</em>. Morphologically,  it can end with any consonant, but there will be an omitted <em><strong>î</strong></em> between the consonant and the apostrophe.</li>
<li>No other phonotactic restrictions.
<ul>
<li><em>tyfranse’, tyankara’ tydjeimz’, tytyrktce’, tydoitclan’, tyantarktika’, tyɛarabiyyä’</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Technically, <em><strong>î</strong></em> and <em><strong>ɛ</strong></em> aren’t considered full letters, so you can insert them anywhere in a word without it counting as a separate or additional word.
<ul>
<li><em>ty<strong>ɛ</strong>arabiyyä’</em> = <em>tyarabiyyä’</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>ty(C|V)*'</strong>
<ul>
<li>Yes, that means <em>ty’</em> is also a valid import.<br>
They are also compound words made up of multiple roots (sometimes particles too), but they are formally considered to be multiple words.<br>
To make a compound, put the words next to each other, and put <em>ai</em> at the end if it’s 2 words, or ui if it is 3.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>dil + jain -&gt; diljainai<br>
syt + mis + kahve -&gt; sytmiskahveui or sytmiskahve’ui</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Morphologically, <em>ai</em> and <em>ui</em> are particles.</p>
<p>When there is an adjacent sequence of 3 vowels along a vowel boundary,</p>
<ul>
<li>the boundary is always after the second vowel,
<ul>
<li>toia -&gt; toi’a</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>unless the left word is part of a root, then it’s after the first vowel.
<ul>
<li>kahveui -&gt; kahve’ui</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="grammar">Grammar</h1>
<p>The verbs are predicates which have a maximum slot amount of 4.</p>
<p>Here are examples of verbs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>klar</strong>: <strong>A</strong> is clear/transparent.</li>
<li><strong>ben</strong>: <strong>A</strong> is me.</li>
<li><strong>jans</strong>: <strong>A</strong> is based on luck, with probablity <strong>E</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>laht</strong>: <strong>A</strong> relates to <strong>E</strong> with connection <strong>I</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>tuhkua</strong>: <strong>A</strong> is turquoise.</li>
<li><strong>poms</strong>: <strong>A</strong> goes to <strong>E</strong> from <strong>I</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>kahans</strong>: <strong>A</strong> is the integral of <strong>E</strong> respect to variable <strong>I</strong> on range <strong>O✱</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a slot is marked with an asterisk (shown with <strong>✱</strong> in this document), it’s called a <em>starred</em> slot.<br>
You can choose to not fill a slot. The transitivity of a slot is how many slots you choose to fill starting from the first slot. For example, if you choose to fill slots <strong>A</strong>, <strong>E</strong> and <strong>I</strong>; you need it to be <strong>triadic</strong>.</p>
<p>To fill a slot of a verb, put an <em>article</em> after a word. The verb’s transitivity is set by which group of articles you use.</p>

</table><p>There is also <em>nu</em> that turns things into a noun, but not an argument of any predicate.</p>
<p>Here are some sentences:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>benba tuhkua.</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>I am turquoise.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table><p>When you fill the argument slot of a verb with another verb, that verb refers to whatever would occupy the <strong>A</strong> slot. For example, if you fill it with <em>ben</em> (“<strong>A</strong> is me”), it applies to anything that fits the <strong>A</strong> role, so in this case, it refers to me.</p>
<p>When you combine two inherently intransitive verbs, the resulting predicate requires both of their <strong>A</strong> roles to be satisfied, it forms an AND relationship between them. So, if something is both <strong>klar</strong> and <strong>ben</strong> at the same time, then it can be described as <strong>klar ben</strong>.</p>
<p>This means the sentence above can optionally be simplified to this:</p>

<th>ben tuhkua.</th>

<tr>
<td>A thing is both me and sleeping.</td>
